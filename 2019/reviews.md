## Favourites:

**Debt: The First 5000 Years** (Audiobook)
*by David Graeber*
I started reading this book almost a decade ago, and I'm so glad I finally got back to it.

**How to Suppress Women’s Writing**
*by Joanna Russ*
An excellent summary of all the ways the literary contributions of women have been erased and minimised throughout history. It made me think about starting to write again. I just wish I had the energy and the time.

**The Binding**
*by Bridget Collins*
I picked this book up at my local bookstore on a whim, because the cover was pretty. I lucked out, because I think this one was my absolute favourite book of 2019. A well-developed world and a fascinating premise which is thoroughly explored both in plot and story structure. Also I loved the old crone character who's the best at her craft because of course I did.

**This Is How You Lose the Time War**
*by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone*
So sweet and cute, and a lot of fun to read with my partner.

**Parable of the Sower**
*by Octavia E. Butler*
I've been meaning to read Octavia Butler's work for a long time, and I finally got there. This book is so precient, and means a lot to me. It talks about how we're going to need to work together and heal socially if we're going to survive the coming decades and centuries.

**Never Let Me Go**
*by Kazuo Ishiguro*
This book got *stuck in my brain*. I couldn't put it down. The subtleties, the world building, the character growth. The brutal resolution brought through with a gentle human emotional arc. Astonishing. The best book I read this year.

**My Year of Rest and Relaxation**
*by Ottessa Moshfegh*
Quirky and brilliant. Strange in the way that real life is strange.

**Circe**
*by Madeline Miller*
I loved this book and this character. I loved seeing the highlights of Greek mythology through the eyes of a misfit minor goddess. I want to be a witch and live on her island of Aiaia forever, it seems very peaceful.

**Persuasion**
*by Jane Austen*
I feel like Austen's later works show even more skill as a writer than her earlier ones. I wish this book had more recognition.

**Northanger Abbey**
*by Jane Austen*
I think it would have been even funnier at the time, since the reader would be more familiar with the gothic novels it's satirising, but still brilliant and hilarious now.

**How To Be Alone**
*by Lane Moore*
Very much needed to read this exact book at this exact time. It was like a big ugly cry and a cuddle in book form.

**The Growth Delusion** (Audiobook)
*by David Pilling*
GDP is a big lie, it's stupid and doesn't measure anything meaningful. Using it in our economic decision making is harmful and we should stop right now. It's like the BMI of economics.

**The Stone Sky, The Obelisk Gate**
*by N. K. Jemisin*
Second and third in the Broken Earth trilogy, the first of which I read last year. I *love* this series.
