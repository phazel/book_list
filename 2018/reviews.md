**The Fifth Season**
*by N. K. Jemisin*

This is the kind of fantasy I wish I'd had growing up. I never really got into the typical fantasy genre, mostly it was just memorising names and places, and it felt on some level like it was catering to someone _else's_ fantasy. It just wasn't for me. So I stuck to sci-fi, and decided I just didn't like fantasy so much.
The last year or two I've been delving into fantasy written by women (as well as sci-fi), and it's been like night and day. This book is essentially the epitome of that difference. I adore this book, and I'm so excited to read the rest of the trilogy, which are already making their way to me on a shipping container as we speak.

**Caliban and the Witch**
*by Silvia Federici*

Have you ever wondered why everything is so shit for women? This book explains why everything is so shit for women, rather than just describing it. How we actually got here. How the stories we tell about gender came to be, and why, and who they were there to benefit. I have become an immense fan of Federici, and I look forward to reading [her new book](https://www.amazon.com/Re-enchanting-World-Feminism-Politics-Commons/dp/1629635693).

**Fingersmith**
*by Sarah Waters*

This was one of my favourite books this year. Her use of character and plot was spectacular. The atmosphere of the old house, the questions left hanging perfectly. The suspense. The heartbreak. Oh god. Read this book, seriously. I don't even just love it because it has girls kissing in it, but it has that too! It did drag a little in the second half, but only in comparison to the spectacularly edge-of-your-seat first half.

**Lud-in-the-Mist**
*by Hope Mirrlees*

This book was a huge surprise. I picked it up on a whim while browsing my local bookstore, and I'm so glad I did! It feels like contemporary fantasy, not something that was written in the 1920s! This girl was ahead of her time. And she was a girl, she wrote this book when she was so young! It's a tragedy that this book has been forgotten, it should be a well-known classic.
There are a few slight annoyances with grammar and particularly spelling (I suspect these are mostly due to errors with automated transcription), but the story is worth it.
The beautiful world she's created, and the sinister magical tone is gorgeous.

**We Who Are About To...**
*by Joanna Russ*

This one really got me. It got _to_ me, it got _inside_ me. It knows what I long for and can never have: just a little bit of peace and quiet, please. After finishing this one I had to go sit in the park for a while.

**Stories of Your Life and Others**
*by Ted Chiang*

Just extremely well-crafted stories.

**Her Body And Other Parties**
*by Carmen Maria Machado*

Short stories that capture the body horror and underlying psychological terror inherent to the experience of being a woman in this world. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
